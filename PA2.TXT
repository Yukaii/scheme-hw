=====================================================================

1. Scheme (50pt)

	function name: inv_app
	input: 2 lists, list1 and list2
	output: inverse of list2 + inverse of list1

	Example:
	list1 = (1 2 3)
	list2 = (a b c)

	output = (c b a 3 2 1)
	  
	Put your source code in a file named pa2scheme1.scm
	and include at lease one test case for your implementation. 

2. Scheme (50pt)

	function name: dbl_atm
	input: an atom and a list
	output: a list with all occurrences of the given atom doubled 

	Example:
	atom = a
	list2 = (a (b c a (a d)))

	output = (a a (b c a a (a a d)))
	  
	Put your source code in a file named pa2scheme2.scm
	and include at lease one test case for your implementation.
